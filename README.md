#									CupCakeslauncher
 
## Description:
#### This is a complete rebuild of my original game manager. I decided to just call it CupCakeslauncher
#### So this is just a simple program That always you to have all your Game's and Program's in one place
#### There is nothing special about this program... Will be adding more as i learn more C#
#### I do Plan in the Future to add terminal.GUI for some of the Gui Interfaces I think it would be a good Implementation.  

=======
## Some Useful Info
#### At the moment the only way to add the location's is via the code it's self...
#### i know inconvenience sorry about that....
=======
## Future Plan's:
#### Better User Gui (Being Worked on With Terminal.Gui).
#### Loading Files And Programs Via Json Files.(Maybe If i Can Figure it out)
#### Installation wizard (Being Worked on With Wix).
