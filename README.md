## Description:
#### This is a complete rebuild of my original game manager. I decided to just call it cupcakes hub
#### So this is just a simple program That always you to have all your Game's and Program's in one place
#### There is nothing special about this program... Will be adding more as i learn more C#
#### This program uses Terminal.Gui for some of the Gui stuff, This is a new Feature  i think will go good with this Manager Hub

=======
## Some Useful Info
#### At the moment the only way to add the location's is via  the code it's self..

#### i know inconvenience sorry about that....

## Future Plan's:
#### Better User Gui (Being Worked on With Terminal.Gui).
#### Loading Files And Programs Via Json Files.
