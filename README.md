## Description:
#### This is just a simple FrameWork That always you to have all your Game's and Program's in one place. I made the code simple so you can add your own Directory path and more options to the menu if you choice so.
#### I do Plan in the Future to add terminal.GUI for some of the Gui Interfaces I think it would be a good Implementation.
=======
## Some Useful Info
#### At the moment the only way to add the location's is via the code it's self...
#### i know inconvenience sorry about that....
#### To Add the location go into the Interfaces Folder and open the ProgramLoader Class...
=======
## Future Plan's:
#### Better User Gui (Being Worked on With Terminal.Gui).
#### Loading Files And Programs Via Json Files.(Maybe If i Can Figure it out)
#### Installation wizard (Being Worked on With Wix).
